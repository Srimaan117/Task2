# Task2
I have used a super store sales dataset.
I have cleaned it prior analysing and visualising.
I have created the following visualisations:
1. Sales by Region & Manager
Chart Type: Stacked Bar Chart
This chart shows how much each region sold, with different colors in the bar representing different managers. 
The west region has the highest sales overall. This helps identify high-performing regions and managers, and where support or training might be needed.

2. Monthly Sales Trend
Chart Type: Line Chart
This shows how sales have changed over time, month by month, from 2015 to 2017.
There are clear sales peaks during certain months, especially at the end of each year. That suggests people buy more during holidays or big events, which helps plan future marketing and stock.

3. Profit by Segment
Chart Type: Donut Chart
This shows how much profit comes from each customer segment, like Home Office, Consumer, or Corporate.
Consumer customers contribute a large portion of the profit. This suggests they’re very valuable to the business and should be a focus for continued support and retention.

4. Top 10 Customers by Sales
Chart Type: Horizontal Bar Chart
This ranks the top 10 customers based on how much they’ve spent.
